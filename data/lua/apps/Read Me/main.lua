Emulators install from the App Library; you provide the game files on the SD card. Each emulator reads its own folder - /gb for GameBoy, /snes for SNES, and so on - or its app folder. Every installed emulator has its own page in the Apps tab of this guide with its file types, folders, settings and default keys, and that page installs along with it.

Quitting a native game, any of these:
- Hold Alt + Backspace for about 1.5 seconds (needs a keyboard).
- Hold the on-screen QUIT button for about a second.
- A key you bound to quit in the launcher's Controls screen.

Each game launcher's ? button shows this plus the game's controls.]] },

-- ── Page set ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- This app's own pages, plus everything lib/helpdocs discovers: system pages
-- under lua/help on either drive, and a readme.lua inside any installed app.
-- Discovery runs nothing for an app page (its title is the app's name) and
-- executes a system page once, in a sandbox, to read its title and order.
-- Orders start at 110 so these sit after the migrated guide pages (10-80) and
-- before About (900). Each is about an app that will carry its own readme.lua,
-- at which point its entry here goes away -- an app must not be described in
-- both places or it appears twice.
