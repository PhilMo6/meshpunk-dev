// ── T-Deck ↔ T-Deck peer link ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A service-multiplexed byte channel between two T-Decks over one USB cable.
// Role A (USB host mode) reaches the peer through the dynamic `espserial` USB
// driver (link socket in the driver ABI); role B (normal USB device) is
// reached through its native USB-Serial-JTAG CDC — this bridge pumps that
// port on a small Core-1 task. Sessions are automatic: the host side sends
// HELLO whenever its driver attaches; keepalives detect cable loss.
//
// Frame: [0xA5 | svc | cmd | seq | len | payload... | crc16_lo | crc16_hi]
// CRC-16-CCITT over everything before the CRC. The device side's TX is
// shared with SLog logging, so the parser resync-scans and drops anything
// failing magic/length/CRC, and frame TX takes the SLog lock so a frame is
// never interleaved mid-line. (The old 1-byte XOR csum had a fatal blind
// spot: a frame truncated by RX-buffer overflow spliced onto the identical
// header of the next frame XORs itself out — hw runs accepted forged TSYNC
// timestamps that way. CRC-16 has no such self-cancelling structure.)
//
// RELIABILITY — the link is lossy (RX overflow under task starvation, TX
// drop when the CDC buffer is full), which every BGB-style protocol upstream
// assumes never happens (BGB rides TCP). So the bridge supplies the missing
// guarantees at the FRAME level:
//   seq == 0  : fire-and-forget. For superseding/idempotent traffic where
//               only the latest matters (TSYNC, ATTACH keepalive, DETACH,
//               session control). Loss is healed by the next one.
//   seq 1..255: reliable, exactly-once, in-order. Receiver replies
//               ACK [svc, seq] (svc 0), dedups by last-delivered seq;
//               sender keeps ONE frame in flight per service (window-1
//               matches gblink's inherent ping-pong: the master's clock
//               freezes until each answer), retransmits every ~30ms until
//               acked, feeds from a small FIFO so order is preserved.
//               Session up/down resets all reliability state on both sides.
//
// Services: 0 = control (session), 1 = gblink (GameBoy link cable — see the
// gnuboy module), 2 = dgram (module-to-module datagrams, see below). Future:
// file transfer, remote serial (reliable delivery comes free from the seq/ack
// layer).
//
// A frame's payload is at most TDL_MAX_PAYLOAD (57) bytes: the whole frame
// is then 64 bytes = exactly one full-speed bulk packet, which is the most
// the espserial USB driver's link_send() hands to one pipe transfer.

// gblink commands (svc 1) — mirrored in the gameboy module's glue.
// The SYNC exchange follows BGB's link protocol: the master sends SYNC1; the
// peer ALWAYS answers — SYNC2 with its byte if it's mid-transfer (armed as
// slave), or SYNC3 "not transferring" if it isn't — so the master never has
// to time out guessing whether a reply is coming.
// gblink is a faithful mapping of the BGB link protocol
// (https://bgb.bircd.org/bgblink.html) onto our framed transport. BGB's b2/b3
// fields ride the payload; BGB's i1 timestamp (2MiHz emulated clocks, 31-bit)
// rides as 4 LE bytes. BGB multiplexes its sync3 on b2 (1 = "got sync1, not
// transferring" ack; 0 = timestamp share) — we give the timestamp form its
// own command id (TSYNC) purely for parser clarity; the semantics are BGB's.
// The lockstep rules live in the gameboy module: emulators exchange TSYNC
// continuously and never run more than a window ahead of the peer's clock; a
// SYNC1 is processed at its timestamp; the master's completion is
// NON-BLOCKING (hardware model: SC bit7 stays set, the CPU keeps running,
// the serial IRQ fires when the SYNC2/SYNC3 answer arrives — the window
// bounds the overrun). Blocking-with-frozen-clock skewed the two timelines
// apart and deadlocked; only the frame-loop window ever stalls real time.
