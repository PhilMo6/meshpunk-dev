// NOTE: the 2026-06 PSRAM heap-corruption hunt instrumentation
// (heap_hunt_report + ~13 checkpoints across the mesh/sound/UI paths)
// lived here. Removed after the bug was found and fixed (fake08 api_sfx
// channel==4 OOB — see the psram-corruption-hunt notes). The walks were
// ~12ms each holding the heap allocator lock, which audibly degraded all
// audio — if corruption hunting is ever needed again, rebuild the
// one-shot heap_caps_check_integrity + heap_caps_dump reporter, arm it
// only for targeted captures, and never judge audio/perf with it armed.
